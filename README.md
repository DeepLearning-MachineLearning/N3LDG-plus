N3LDG-plus
===========================
N3LDG++ is a neural network libary based on dynamic graph for natural language processing.

I'm the author to implement the first GPU implementation of N3LDG and I love N3LDG sincerely. To develop a GPU faster and well-designed N3LDG, I derive it independently, thereby being able to develop it according to my own ideas and remvoing some original C++ codes of bad taste, without the restriction of being compatible of those N3LDG-based repos.

I wish N3LDG++ a better N3LDG.

## Installation:
### Prerequisitions:

boost 1.68(a fairly late version may be satisfied) is required.

CUDA 8.0 is required if you wan't to run it on GPU.
